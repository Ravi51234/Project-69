      <p class="text-muted">There are aspects of life that everybody takes part in. Two of those things, at least here in the south, is going to church and school. Going to church on a Sunday morning is just as routine as going to school on Monday morning. People go to church and listen to the pastor give his or her sermon for the day like one would go to school and listen to the teacher give his or her lesson for the day. Both play a role in everyday life for people and can have major effects in people’s lives. The similarities of church and school are interesting to look at, as are the differences. To begin with, the practice of going to church has been around longer than that of attending school has been. Attending church is where people back in the 15th and 16th …show more content…
        Church is there for when people want to look to a higher power other than themselves. The Church can be a great and powerful thing, but if solely relied on for everything it can be a bit confusing when facing different situations. School, however, can show us the answer to these situations. Math, science, and english can show us the answers to the questions we have and how to solve those questions we have. What a pastor has to say will most likely be different than that of a teacher. As of lately, schools have not been open minded to letting the church be involved inside the walls. No prayer or other religion activities are to be lead by teachers or other faculty members, while the church pushes for these things to happen.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">A library is a location where numerous collections of books are kept. The extensive library at my school is next to the auditorium. Once a week, our class goes to the library. Our library has a variety of picture books, novels, comics, and other materials.

        Due to my passion for reading books and magazines, I look forward to my time in the library. The reading area in my school's library is a big table surrounded by bookcases. We refer to the books in our library when we have any assignments to complete. I also use my free time to visit the school library. We can also issue the library books and take them home.My school has a large library with a wide selection of books on many subjects. Twice a week, we have designated time for the library. Each class has a library period during the weekly schedule. My greatest reason to go to the library is that I can read my favourite books there. My school's library is tastefully decorated. It is a sizable hall that is well illuminated and ventilated. There is a huge section in the middle intended for seating children. We sit in rows most of the time. The books are arranged all around the seating area.</p>

      <p class="tetx-muted">I read in a very big school. Likewise, it has a big hall. It is also known as the auditorium. It has a sound-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.

        It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.
        
        There is a vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for the speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.
        
        The front door is the widest. The four other doors two in the either wall are ‘comparatively less wide. Besides, there are two small doors behind the dais which open into small green houses.</p>
